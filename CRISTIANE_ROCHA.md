My name is Cristiane Rocha


I like to practice dance and yoga, cause is the union between soul, body and mind that works good 
for me.
I like to eat soup cause winter is comming, now I can tell is my favorite food. As this can 
change seasonally.
My favorite kind of music now is this one today:

A funny fact about myself is I am a multi artist, that means I love to enjoy, create and 
experience different kind of art...

I dont remember anything else to write interesting of me, maybe I can rephrase tomorrow if I 
think something better haha
